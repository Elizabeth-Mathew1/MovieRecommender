### :mortar_board:  About the project

Movie Recommender recommends you top five movies based on a single entry of a movie. The project explores [content based filtering](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-content-based-filtering) 
of data, which is a type of recommender system that attempts to guess what a user may like based on that userâ€™s activity. Content-based filtering makes 
recommendations by using keywords and attributes assigned to objects in a database. Youtube uses CBF along with other filtering techniques. 
The backend services is provided [streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/) and is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/what).

The different stages of the project included:
  1) Preprocessing where the data from two csv files which contained information about 4086 movies were processed for futher detailing.
  2) Model building where a model was trained using the algorithm of k-nearest neighbours using CountVectorizer and cosine_similarity libraries.
  3) Website building done using streamlit
  4) Deployed on Heroku
